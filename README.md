# CS-355-Dashboard
Dashboard created to host all of my assignments for my Internet and Web Technologies course at Queens College

This website was created as a dashboard to host all of my assignments for the semester.  The first assignment being the dashboard itself focuses on creating a navigation bar with a responsive drop down menu.  The dropdown menu holds each of the assignments, where each assignment is a link to another webpage.
